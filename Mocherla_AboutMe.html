           Pursuing something you never thought you would pursue? Me too. My 
           initial aspiration, since kindergarten, was to enter the medicine 
           field. Because of my previous passions and a very special class, I 
           aspire to be a Biotechnologist. As high school dawned upon me and my 
           <a href="https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/pltw-computer-science" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering class</a> 
           became the center of my attention, my perspective started to 
           change. CSE, or Computer Science and Engineering, is a class in which
           students learn different coding languages and are able to create our 
           own websites, games, and applications from the scratch. Through group
           projects, I saw how much the machine we know as the computer has 
           brought us together and helped humans to connect. I was able to 
           experience firsthand, the power of a computer and its code.

          As a freshman, I have been on the Junior Varsity Tennis Team and have been a 
          Girl Scout for 5 years. I have also been volunteering on almost a weekly 
          basis for the last couple of years through the <a href="http://www.region7saicenters.org/region7new/" target="_blank">Northern California 
          Sai Organization</a>. I have also won a few awards for my artwork through 
          <a href="https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections" target="_blank">Reflections</a> and Bighelp. Through all of these experiences I have 
          connected with others, built bonds and bettered myself in one way or 
          another. Whether the problem is losing a tennis match or being deprived 
          of that last beautiful Girl Scout badge, having a positive attitude and 
          being tolerant and focused has helped me achieve exactly what I wanted. 
          I feel theses qualities will help me in the lab or in the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
          All these extracurriculars and daily duties have provided me with skills
          and have given me the characteristics that I have today. I consider 
          myself to be self-motivated and ambitious because of tennis, cooperative 
          yet independent because of <a href="https://www.gsnorcal.org/" target="_blank">Girl Scouts</a>, creative from my art and photography, 
          and understanding from volunteering. Lastly, because I am a CSE student,
          I have learned to be persistent and plan accurately. Everything I do is 
          because I, myself, am motivated to do them. I excel in anything I set my
          mind to and my mind has been set on a Biotechnology major and it is 
          a goal that I will definitely reach.
