           <h4><b>Project:</b> MIT App Inventor - Atari Breakout<br></h4>
           <h4><b>Course:</b> Computer Science and Engineering<br></h4>
           <h4>September 20, 2017 to October 6, 2017<br></h4>
           <p>
           My partner and I had brainstormed project ideas on Day #1 and decided upon the classic game of Atari Breakout
           to recreate using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor</a>. We used a multitude of sprites, and a variety of algorithms and were able 
           to navigate App Inventor with the help of of our peers, our teacher, and of course the internet. There were 
           some difficult aspects. We were unable to allow users to angle the ball correctly, but eventually, made up 
           for it by adding more levels and more challenges. We learnt to call on different aspects at different times 
           and became experts on variable control, in MIT App Inventor at least. I worked mostly on the transitions 
           between the screens, variable activation, and the basic layout/structure for the game. Our class was also 
           required to create a notebook, in which we documented our progress and better showcased our end result: 
           the project. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jrOmfFH8jhoC25llbisZR-1Ibu5cL7eVQUitWcwOfw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">notebook</a> consisted of much professional writing that had to be clear and 
           concise, which was determined by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKxBJ8p1D29osrefFO4Vbct1u9FTmrt8wTWDEO4hYKQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rubric</a>.<br>My partner and I received an “A” on this project.

           <h4><b>Project:</b> Python - American Humane Association Image Manipluation<br></h4>
           <h4><b>Course:</b> Computer Science and Engineering<br></h4>
           <h4>March 6, 2018 to March 25, 2018<br></h4>
           <p>
           This project revolved around changing/manipulating the appearance of 
           an image based on the requirements posed by a variety of fictitous 
           clients (client options provided in project instructions). My partner
           and I had chosen Client #1: A Cause. On Day #1 we chose to represent 
           the American Humane Association for our cause. We focused on three 
           main image manipulations, overlapping an image over the original,
           adding a border of circles and and adding a soild-colored border. 
           We also decided to add the watermark of the AHA. Just like any 
           project, there were some difficult aspects; At first we were unable 
           to figure out how to have the code iterate over an entire file without
           interruption, but the code was unable to return all images in a 
           folder as well. Through hours of experimentation, I finally understood
           came to the solution by researching how certain PIL.Image methods 
           affect others. I worked mostly the completion of all three borders
           and fixed the ability for the code to iteratre over an entire folder.
           Our class was also required to create a notebook or sort to document 
           our progress and we showcase our end result. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ocuQMOQlV1vCO1bBSow0oM79gEAOqFVs6x4ZvekkI60" target="_blank">notebook</a> consisted 
           of much professional writing that had to be clear and 
           concise, which was determined by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nm8KP_3KMR7Zcirw9ana57bFzw3gbN2HM_9K6iomzQs/edit" target="_blank">rubric</a>.<br>
